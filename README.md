### Project Description
This project aims to provide part time job opportunities for students and working professionals who seek additional income and skill development without compromising their primary commitments. Our initiative connects job seekers with flexible work options across various industries, ensuring a balance between work, studies and personal life.

### The Problem statement
There is a gap between companies needing reliable part-time workers and students or employees seeking flexible job opportunities. Many struggle to find work that fits their schedules, while businesses face workforce shortages. This project connects job seekers with companies, ensuring efficient workforce management and accessible employment opportunities.

### The Solution
To address this problem, we propose developing a website that acts as a bridge between students, employees, and companies. This platform will provide a centralized job portal where businesses can post part-time job openings, and job seekers can easily find opportunities that match their schedules and skills.
